# AutomaticLineChangeover

The Automatic Line Changeover (ALC) device is a sophisticated power management system designed to optimize energy consumption. By intelligently monitoring two utility lines, the ALC automatically switches between them based on factors such as availability and predefined energy unit limits set by the consumer. 

To protect sensitive appliances from potential damage caused by power fluctuations, the ALC incorporates robust safety features. These include over and under voltage cutoff mechanisms that automatically disconnect the load when voltage levels exceed or fall below safe operating parameters. Additionally, a delay function prevents accidental power surges that can occur when power is restored after a brief outage.

The device empowers consumers with granular control over their energy usage by allowing them to specify maximum consumption limits for each utility line. This feature enables effective load management and cost savings. 
 
Essentially, the ALC enhances power reliability, protects appliances, and provides users with greater flexibility in managing their energy consumption.
